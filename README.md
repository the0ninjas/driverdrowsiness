**Driver’s drowsiness detection using convolutional neural networks and transfer learning**

This project focuses on developing a driver’s drowsiness detection system using convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image classification. The dataset, comprising images categorized into four classes (closed eyes, open eyes, yawning, and no yawn), underwent standard data preprocessing and data augmentation technique. Initial model training revealed a baseline accuracy of 74%, prompting the incorporation of transfer learning with InceptionV3 to enhance performance. The refined model achieved an accuracy of 80%, indicating improved precision, recall, and f1-scores across the different classes. The application of real-time image classification was explored using tools like Roboflow, showcasing the potential for practical deployment in real-world scenarios.
